"""The OLAP readings and their charts.

The readings are the reason this module is tested rather than trusted. They are
sentences making specific claims about specific numbers, derived in Python from
the rows an operation just returned — which means they *can* be wrong, and four
of them were:

- `slice_year` assumed a `year_no` column. There isn't one; the rows are topic
  totals by group. It reported **"No rows matched" about a sixteen-row result.**
- `topic_mix` assumed `year_month`. It is yearly, and reported "across 1 months".
- `cube` read whichever text column came first, which was `topic_name`, and
  reported **"sentiment is mostly Entertainment"**.
- `drill_across` claimed volatility "starts once twenty days have accumulated"
  while reporting it present on every single row.

Every one of those was a confident sentence attached to real numbers, which is
the precise failure this project exists to prevent. Hence `test_a_reading_never_claims_an_empty_result`,
which is the check that would have caught all of them.
