"""Shared pytest fixtures.

Tests never touch the real warehouse, data/raw, or reports/. Every fixture
writes to a tmp_path so the suite is safe to run at any time.

The `reports_dir` redirect below is not optional. The mining and inference
stages write their artefacts to a fixed reports directory, so without it a
test run silently replaced the real full-corpus `reports/mining.json` with
results computed from a ten-row fixture, and the report then rendered three
paired trading days as though that were the finding.
