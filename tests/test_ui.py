"""Verification for the dashboard front end.

**These tests exist because the build had no way to see the page it was
producing.** Everything here checks something that is invisible in a passing
test suite and obvious on screen: a colour variable that was never defined, a
chart name that does not exist, a data path that silently renders "n/a", text
too faint to read.

That last class is the expensive one. A wrong key in a JavaScript template does
not raise — it renders `undefined`, or an em dash, or nothing. The page still
loads, the server still returns 200, and every other test still passes. Each of
those bugs shipped once during this build and was caught here rather than by a
reader.

One of them was not cosmetic. `build_outcomes` emitted its per-outcome caveat
under the key `caveat` while the rest of the project spells it `caution`, so
**every caution on the conclusions page silently rendered as absent** — on the
single page whose entire job is to state what may not be claimed. Nothing
raised. The only way it surfaced was asserting that each outcome carries one.

The four families:

* **Wiring** — every CSS variable is defined, every element id the JavaScript
  reaches for exists, every chart the JavaScript names is served.
* **Data paths** — every dotted path the front end reads exists in the real
  payload. Asserted against what mining actually produces, not a fixture,
  because the bug is a mismatch with reality.
* **Contrast** — WCAG AA for the text pairs in both themes.
* **Honesty** — no figure anywhere in the payload has a unit and no caution.
