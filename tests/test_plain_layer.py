"""The plain-language layer must not drift from the measurements.

`dwm/inference/plain.py` exists so a reader with no data-warehousing background
can reach a conclusion from this dashboard. It does that by restating measured
values in ordinary English, and every number in it is interpolated from
`facts.json` rather than retyped — so it cannot drift *by construction*.

That property is easy to state and easy to lose. The moment someone adds a
sentence with a hard-coded figure, or a measurement changes and the sentence is
not revisited, the layer starts confidently asserting numbers nobody measured.
That is the single worst failure mode this project has: a fluent sentence
containing a figure nobody computed.

So the restating is asserted here, against the real `facts.json`. Each check
pairs a quoted fragment with the fact it must agree with.
