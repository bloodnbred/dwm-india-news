"""Warehouse build stage (Phase 3): fact tables, bridge, cubes.

Takes the clean tables and the feature tables from the feature stage and
produces the queryable warehouse:

    fact_headline, fact_statement, fact_market_daily
    cube_month_topic, cube_year_topic, cube_topic_sentiment, cube_day_topic

(dim_keyword and bridge_headline_keyword are written by the feature stage,
because keyword extraction has to happen in the same pass as scoring.)

The Phase 3 gate is *"fact row counts equal clean row counts; keys unique"*.
It is checked in `check_gates` and is enforced with `strict=True` by the
tests.
