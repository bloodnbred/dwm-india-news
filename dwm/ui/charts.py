"""Vega-Lite chart specifications, built in Python.

**Why these live here and not in the browser.** Rendering a chart is not
computing a finding, so putting the specs in JavaScript would not violate the
"the dashboard computes nothing" rule. They are here anyway, for two reasons
that turned out to matter:

1. **They are testable.** A malformed spec is a crash at page load, and the only
   way to catch that without a browser is to build the spec in Python and
   validate it. That is a unit test. A spec assembled in JS is only ever
   exercised when someone opens the page.
2. **They stay consistent.** One palette, one axis style, one set of rules, in
   one file. Six charts built in three places drift immediately, and "drift" in
   a chart library looks like a subtle wrongness nobody can name.

The theme is a parameter rather than a constant. A hard-coded light palette is
what made the previous dashboard unreadable on a machine set to dark: the CSS
forced a light canvas while the framework rendered dark charts over it. Here
both are designed and the client asks for the one it is actually using.

**The sorting rule, which exists because of a bug.** A nominal axis in
Vega-Lite is a set of unordered strings, and its default order is whatever the
data happens to produce. An earlier version of the RQ2 chart sorted its month
axis with `sort="-x"`, which ordered the event months by their *z-score*: the
chart showed 2020-05 next to 2016-12 and read as a chronological series that was
not one. Every nominal axis in this module is therefore given an explicit sort
list, sorted by the natural order of the label, never by a measure.

# asserts they have not drifted. Note that these are the *text* colours, which
# are darker than the pure brand hues: `#0071E3` on a tinted background measures
