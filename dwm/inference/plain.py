"""The plain-language layer.

**Why this exists.** The dashboard was correct and unreadable. It said
`silhouette 0.2582` and `LSA component 1` and `313 tautological rules` and
expected a reader to supply the meaning. Somebody without a data-warehousing
background could read every number and come away with no conclusion, which
makes the rest of the project pointless.

So: one translation layer, sitting beside the technical one rather than
replacing it. Both audiences, same page. A viva examiner still finds the
silhouette, the lift and the p-values; a first-time visitor gets a sentence they
can act on.

**Two rules govern everything in this file.**

1. **Every number is interpolated from the measured value, never retyped.**
   Each sentence below reads its figures out of `facts.json`. If a measurement
   changes, the sentence changes with it. Hand-typed numbers in prose drift, and
   a drifted sentence is worse than no sentence — it is a confident lie.

2. **Plain is not vague.** "There is some structure here" is not plain English,
   it is a hiding place. Each finding names what was measured, what the number
   means against its possible range, and what it does not license. The brevity
   comes from short sentences, not from withholding the caveat.

`test_plain_layer.py` asserts that every figure quoted here matches the fact it
claims to come from, so rule 1 is machine-enforced rather than a convention.
