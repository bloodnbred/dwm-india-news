"""The query layer behind the API and the dashboard (Phase 8).

**The API serves results; it does not recompute them.** Every figure it returns
comes from `facts.json`, which the inference stage rendered from the warehouse.
An endpoint that ran its own SQL would be a second, unreviewed path to the
same numbers, and the two would drift.

One exception, and it is deliberate: `/query` runs the Phase 4 OLAP operations
against the warehouse, because those exist precisely to answer ad-hoc slicing
questions. It is read-only, whitelisted to the ten named operations, and every
response states which operation ran.

**Read-only is a property of the file, not a promise.** The DuckDB file is
opened `read_only=True`, so a malformed parameter cannot write to the
warehouse even if validation were bypassed.
