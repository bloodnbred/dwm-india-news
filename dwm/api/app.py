"""FastAPI backend (Phase 8): read-only access to the results and the warehouse.

Design constraints, all of them deliberate:

**The API never recomputes a published number.** Everything under `/facts`,
`/report` and `/summary` is read from `facts.json`, which the inference stage
rendered. If this layer ran its own aggregate for a headline figure, the report
and the dashboard would be two unreviewed paths to the same number, and they
would drift.

**Read-only is enforced by the file, not by good intentions.** The DuckDB
handle is opened `read_only=True`, so no malformed request can write to the
warehouse even if validation were bypassed entirely.

**Every response that reports a rate also reports its denominator and its
name.** The project's central honesty rule is that a rate on unlabelled
headlines is a *risk-signal rate*, never a fake-news rate. An API that returned
`{"rate": 0.109}` would strip the word that makes it correct, so the responses
carry `metric_name`, `denominator` and `caution` alongside every value.

**A missing warehouse is 503, not 500.** "You have not built it yet" is a
different situation from "the server is broken", and the message says which
command to run.
