"""A plain-language reading of each OLAP result.

**The problem this solves.** All ten operations return correctly-named,
well-shaped rows. The dashboard threw that away and rendered
`JSON.stringify(row)` into a single "Payload" column, so an operation that
computed a clean cross-tabulation arrived as a wall of JSON. Nothing was wrong
with the data; everything was wrong with how it was shown.

**Why this is Python and not JavaScript.** The same reason as everything else in
this project: a sentence summarising a measurement is a claim, and a claim should
be testable. `reading` is derived here from the rows the operation just returned,
so it cannot drift away from them, and a test asserts it.

**Every reader profiles the rows first rather than assuming column names.** The
first version assumed `slice_year` had a `year_no` column and `topic_mix` had
`year_month`. Neither is true — the first returns topic totals by group, the
second is yearly — so both produced confident readings of data that was not
there, one of them literally saying "No rows matched" about a sixteen-row result.

A wrong reading is worse than no reading: it is a specific, plausible claim
attached to real numbers, and it is exactly what this project exists to prevent.
So the readers below discover the shape (`_profile`) and then interpret what is
actually there. `_tests/test_olap_readings.py` asserts that no reader reports an
empty result for a non-empty one, which is the check that would have caught it.
