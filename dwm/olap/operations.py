"""OLAP operations (Phase 4).

The eight operations the blueprint asks for, each a named function returning
rows, so the API, the dashboard and the report all call the same code:

    slice        one dimension member fixed
    dice         several dimension members fixed
    roll_up      aggregate up a hierarchy, using stored sums
    drill_down   the reverse of roll_up
    pivot        one measure across two dimensions
    cube         all groupings of a small dimension set, in one pass
    drill_across a join between fact tables that share conformed keys
    slice_and_dice  a parameterised combination of the first two

Two rules hold throughout.

**Sums, never averages.** Averages do not roll up. Every operation returns
counts and column sums, plus a precomputed mean where it is genuinely
convenient, and the mean is always `sum / count` derived at query time. A test
asserts no OLAP result silently averages a stored sum.

**The headline window is the default.** Every operation filters `in_window`
unless told otherwise, because the analysis questions are about the five-year
window. Passing `in_window=False` explores the whole archive, and the
returned row count says which was used.

    for the CLI and the API to disagree about what an operation returns.

    The result carries a plain-language `reading` alongside its rows. Every

    renders only the rows shows the reader a table and leaves them to work out
    what it means, which is half a job done. The reading is derived from the
